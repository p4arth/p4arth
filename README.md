<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Paarth</h1>


I'm a 21 years old Machine Learning practitioner based in Delhi. I'm pursuing my bachelors's in Data Science while working as a machine learning engineer in the Chandigarh area. I have been in the field of machine learning for a while now, learning new stuff, working on various problems in computer vision, demand forecasting, and natural language understanding. Currently you'll find me studying diffusion models, learning PyTorch and advocating as a Hugging Face student ambassador. I'm actively trying to work on projects involving convnets.
