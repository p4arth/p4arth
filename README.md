<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Paarth</h1>


I'm a 19 years old Machine Learning practitioner based in Delhi. I'm pursuing my bachelors's in Data Science while working as an intern at a data science consulting company. I have been in the field of machine learning for more than a year now, learning new stuff, working on various problems, ranging from Demand Forecasting to Natural Language Understanding. Currently you'll find me studying natural language processing, learning PyTorch and advocating as a Hugging Face student ambassador. I'm actively trying to work on projects involving language models.
